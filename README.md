# Canvas Grading Distribution Tool
You may use this script for any purpose, but please retain the author information.

A bash script to generate a grading distribution from Canvas data. It takes in a .csv gradebook file and a file with a list of graders, and outputs a distribution for the graders. Please notify me of bugs.

Example grader data file:
```
Smith, Joe
Davis, Sally
Kirk, James
```
